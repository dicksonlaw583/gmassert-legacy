# GMAssert (Workbench)
Assertion scripts for GameMaker Studio 1.x

## Introduction
GMAssert is a library containing useful assertions for debugging and automated unit testing. You can use it to alert you to undesirable runtime conditions and pause the debugger at that point for further inspection.

## Requirements
- GameMaker Studio 1.4 or above

## Contributing to GMAssert
This is the official workbench for the library. Please make and test your changes here first.
+ Clone both `gmassert` and `gmassert-workbench`.
+ Open the workbench in GameMaker Studio and make your additions/changes to the `gmassert` script group. Also add corresponding tests to the `gmassert_test` script group.
+ Export the `gmassert` script group to `gmassert-workbench`, overwriting its copy of `gmassert.gml`.
+ Open a pull request on both `gmassert` and `gmassert-workbench`.
